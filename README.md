# Grist New York Drought Analysis
In this repo, I attempt to recreate the analysis from the Grist article [*Why drought looks different depending on your region*](https://grist.org/drought/northeast-flash-drought-us-west-dryness-regional-difference/) by [Chad Small](https://grist.org/author/chad-small/). Just getting some practice playing with geospatial visualizations and climate data.
